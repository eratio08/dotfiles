# DO's
- Always `code-index_set_project_path` to the current project
- Use the `code-index` tools to search code
- Use the `ast-grep` tools for structural code search and transformation

# DONT's
- Do not write any code comments
- Keep the code as simple as possible (KISS)
- Avoid abstractions until they have been discovered to be truly needed
